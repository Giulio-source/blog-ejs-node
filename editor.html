<h1>WHAT ARE ROTARY JOINTS & ROTARY UNIONS?</h1>
<p>
  A rotary joint, also referred to as a rotary union or rotating union, is a
  rotary sealing device that connects rotating equipment to fixed piping for the
  transfer of steam, water, thermal oil, coolant, hydraulic oil, air, and other
  media. Rotary unions can be designed with multiple passages and manage
  multiple media types simultaneously. In these cases, a soft seal such as an
  O-ring is used to prevent the fluids from “crossing-over” into another
  passage. Soft seal multi-passage rotary unions are used in a variety of
  industries and applications including oil and gas, food and beverage,
  aerospace, robotics, and medical devices. In some applications, the rotary
  union is fitted with slip rings for transmitting electrical signals as well as
  hydraulic power.
  <br />
  With conventional rotary joints, a spring-loaded seal is used to keep the
  fluid or gas medium from being dispersed into the atmosphere. The fluid or gas
  in many applications is to create a temperature change to the product that is
  produced. For example, steam to dry paper, water to cool the rolls on which
  metal billets are produced, hot water to heat the plastic granulates and cold
  water to cool the plastic film. In all these cases the rotary joint has a
  mechanical seal. The mechanical seal is the heart of the rotary joint and is
  either balanced or unbalanced. With an unbalanced mechanical seal, the spring
  is used in the rotary joint to maintain the initial internal seating, and the
  rotary joint is pressure-sealed once in operation. Low-pressure or vacuum
  service relies on the spring force to create the seal. Conventional rotary
  joints are either self-supported with the use of an internal carbon guide, or
  external-supported using rods or a mounting bracket.

  Balanced seal rotary unions are generally used with fluid service (e.g. water,
  coolant, etc.), but can be used with steam and other gases. Balanced seal
  technology relies on optimizing the spring pressure to create a positive seal
  within the rotary union. The operating pressure of the media has little, if
  any, effect on the seal load. Balanced seals are typically flat face seals and
  the rotary unions are supported by ball bearings.
  <br />
  The seals are the main wearing components of a rotary joint and rotary union.
  During operation, seals can experience internal loading forces from fluid
  pressure, as well as friction from contact between the sealing faces. Factors
  related to the machine speed, temperature, and media used can also affect the
  life of the seal ring. To a large extent, a rotary union is only as good as
  its seal package. Poor quality seals naturally wear out more rapidly, leading
  to an increase in maintenance, downtime, and repair cost. When a seal fails,
  media escapes and the efficiency of the entire heating or cooling process
  suffers. All of this makes the actual replacement cost of the seal just a
  small portion of the total cost of a seal failure. <br />Fluids influence the
  type of mechanical seal that is being required. Some fluids like air are not
  very good lubricators. In that case 2 seal materials are often used that in
  combination will create a lubrification between the sliding faces. In other
  cases, like water or oil the fluid will create a very thin lubricating film
  that will reduce wear of the seal faces. Seals are often not made of the same
  seal materials. Usually there is a harder and a relatively softer material.
  This will help the seal faces to adapt to each other’s wear during their
  lifetime and remain tightly closed. But also 2 hard seal materials can be used
  like silicon carbide and tungsten carbide. When 2 harder materials are used
  this is very good for water that contains dirt particles. An example is
  unfiltered water. For the longevity of the rotary joint filtered fluids are
  giving the best results.
